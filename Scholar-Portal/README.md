# Scholar-Portal
There are many types of scholarships available for students, but many students have no idea about the scholarships they may get. It is also difficult to gather information from different websites and understanding various criteria. Also there is a lot of hassle regarding the scholarship form filling and deadlines as many students donâ€™t know the proper steps to apply. As well as there are not many website that provide a centralized way to apply for both private and government scholarships. 
The objective of this project is to develop a scholarship recommendation system that can accurately identify eligible students and recommend appropriate scholarship programs based on their academic performance, financial need, and other relevant factors. 
Provide them with proper steps to apply for different scholarships. Help them know different documents required to apply for the scholarships. 
By knowing reviews about various scholarship it can help user to decide whether to apply for that scholarship.
